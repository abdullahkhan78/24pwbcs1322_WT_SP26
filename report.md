# Lab 01 Reflection

In this lab, I learned how to install Git and Visual Studio Code.  
I created a local repository and connected it to GitHub.  
I practiced committing files, adding HTML comments, and creating a .gitignore and LICENSE file.  
I also learned how to create branches, make experimental changes, and merge them back into the main branch.  
This lab improved my understanding of Git workflow and version control in web development.
